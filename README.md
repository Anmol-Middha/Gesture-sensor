# Gesture-sensor
An arduino project where you can control any of your laptop by just waving hands in front of UV sensors.
## Apparatus Required 
The components you need is 
1. Arduino board
2. Two ultra-violet sensors 

## Circuit Diagram 
![alt text](https://github.com/Anmol-Middha/Gesture-sensor/blob/master/circuit%20diagram.png)

## Concept 
1.Initialize the serial number to your arduino code
2.Apply algorithm for calculating distance between the sensors and your hand.
3.Apply conditions on the distance between hand and uv sensors
4.Use same serial number in your python code to integerate it with arduino.
5.Import pyautogui library which allows to integerate your keyboard to the arduino.
6.Apply the keyboard keys which you want to function at a particular distance of hand.

## How to compile 
1. Upload the arduino code into your arduino board
2. Download  pyautogui library of python 
3. Run the python code
